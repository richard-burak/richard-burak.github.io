    In the first week, we were instructed to make an LED blink on a Raspberry Pi. This lab was meant to teach us how to use and interface with the Pi.<br>

    With the budget proposed, I now understand the materials required. Anything that I am not in possession of will be ordered from RobotShop, or purchased from Sayal. A log of the items will be posted once the they have arrived.<br>

    The next step is to put the basic hardware of the project together. The circuit has been planned out, and now must be built and tested. Stated in the report above, I have completed my PCB and done basic testing. A video of the board running will be edited and posted for next week.<br>

    The three of us working on the project have previously made a simple light sensor circuit together. I plan to use either this circuit, or the sensor provided by the Humber PCB. This will be decided as testing of the PCB continues.<br>
    <img src="Images/LightSensor.png" alt="Light Sensor Circuit" style="width:500px;height:400px;"><br>
    We also got together to create the same circuit for the project. Using Fritzing, we created a layout. This will be constructed and tested in the lab period.<br>
    <img src="Images/Layout.png" alt="Fritzing Layout" style="width:500px;height:400px;"><br>
    The video showing off the components and tools required for the project is posted below. This will be edited to fit in the eventual build video.<br>

    This week, my goal was to have a Placard ready for the project. The Solar Project members got together to create this. The placard .pub file will be uploaded to my repository, and the other members will post links to the same file.<br>

    Below is a short video showing the PCB successfully running on a Raspberry Pi. This will not be used in the final build video, but it has been posted as a demonstration.

  <p>
    The Solar Panel project group got together this week to begin testing circuit designs. A functioning circuit has been successfully created and tested, and all of the sensors work. Readings are also successfully displayed in the Raspberry Pi terminal, though light level and solar cell voltage will required some conversions into their respective units. Below, a 30 second build video is posted to show the progress made on the project so far, and what I plan to show next. All three group members used the same template for our videos to remain consistent. The next step will be the conversion for the two values stated above, and designing a case for the open house. The final step will be storing the data in a database.

    The two previous videos are still available for viewing, but are not considered as part of the build video. Finally, two circuits have been designed. One includes the Modular Sensor Hat that was previously soldered, and the other does not require it. The plan is to use the one with the Modular Sensor Hat.

    I hope to demonstrate my project in class this week, as making the open house may not be a possibility. I have attached my third progress report.<br>

  <p>
    This week a plan for a custom PCB has been completed. Details of this can be found in the document attached.<br>
    Below is a screenshot of the board file we created. It is a very basic circuit, but will clean up the project nicely. This design was mainly worked on by Steven, but I will edit it to accompany my different DHT-11 breakout.<br>
    <br>Not mentioned in the report is the financial update. My instructor asked me to update this during class: No additional funds have been spent on the project at the time. I hope to purchase rectangular connectors to solder to my custom PCB. This should not cost much, so I will remain under budget.

    The PCB from the last log entry has been printed, and is ready to solder. The code for the Sensor Hat LED has been implemented to change colour depending on sensor status.
    The headers (rectangular connectors) for the custom PCB were ordered from Digi-Key, and were delivered quickly. More details are included in this week's status report.<br>

    A presentation has been created, and is ready to be shown in class on Tuesday November 29th.<br>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HuwditKgQx7AoN1jPlrv7YETbwR5FcB54mhs3n1VhEw">In-class Presentation</a><br><br>
    Below is the PCB that was printed. It has been soldered, but I believe there is a short circuit that must be fixed. Another DHT-11 fell victim to a bad connection, so I have ordered another one. 
	I must resolder one of the connections before continuing with the custom PCB, so the old configuration will be used during the presentation. Also, progress has been made on the project box in CorelDRAW, 
	but the file is not ready to publish. Once we measure everything correctly, we will be ready to order the PCB standoffs required.<br>

    Finally, I have updated the budget with how much I have currently spent on the project.

  <H3>Week 14</H3>
	<p>
		This week, the build instructions have been completed. A link to them can be found in the quick links to the right. I put them on a separate page, as they would take up a significant portion of this site.
		As for the final steps of the project, a custom acrylic box has been designed. My group member, Steven Spiteri, got his laser cut to see if the outcome would be what we expected. Since the box is exactly
		as expected, I will have mine laser cut this week, when the prototype lab is available. Regarding the PCB reported last week, I have scrapped it entirely. I emailed the prototype lab an updated version
		that will be easier to solder, so I hope to also get that done this week.

		Last week I was able to finalize my project. I soldered and tested a new custom PCB (which works this time), laser cut my own box, and successfully constructed the final hardware for this semester.
		While the case is black and opaque (bad for light level readings), this was unavoidable as the Prototype Lab had run out of 3mm tranparent acrylic.
		<img src="Images/final_box.jpeg" alt="Finished Project" style="width:600px;height:500px;"><br><br>
		Finally, my 30 second script for the video to be filmed on Tuesday December 13th has been completed:
		<blockquote>
			<i> 
				Hi, my name is Richard Burak, and I was among those responsible for building the Solar Panel Project. The project is built using a Broadcom development platform to interface with a solar cell 
				and a variety of sensors. All of the data is gathered using these on-board sensors, which collect information about the humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, and light level around the
				hardware. Because the power generation of the solar cell is also tracked, it can be correlated with the weather data and used to further our research into solar energy.
